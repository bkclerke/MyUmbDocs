# Component Library Explained

The component library is a library of components that are derived from the website design evaluation. Every page component is different. Most page components have a standard composition applied that inherits from the [Component Settings](v8/Component-Settings.md) document type. Page Components are configured based on these [Development Guidelines](v8/Development-Guidelines.md).

## How It Works

Each Component Page will have a Page Components Folder as a child node. The [Page Components Folder](/MyUmbDocs/Starterkit-Package/Doctype-Page-Comp-Folder-Schema.html) child node is auto generated by the `~/App_Code/PageComponents.cs` file. Once the "Save" or "Save and Publish" event for the configured parent document types is triggered, the child page components folder will auto generate.

### Component Code Files

The file naming conventions are detailed in the [Development Guidelines](v8/Development-Guidelines.md). Per the recommendations for file naming, page components code will be located in the `~/Views/Partials/PageComponents/` folder and named similar to the doctype alias' name like so: `_PC_doctypeAlias.cshtml`.
