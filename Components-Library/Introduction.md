# Component Library Explained

The component library is a library of components that are derived from the website design evaluation. Every page component is different. Most page components have a standard composition applied to inherit [Component Settings](v8/Component-Settings.md) however most are configured based on a standard setup against these [Development Guidelines](v8/Development-Guidelines.md).

## How It Works

Each Component Page will have a Page Components Folder as a child node. The [Page Components Folder](/MyUmbDocs/Starterkit-Package/Doctype-Page-Comp-Folder-Schema.html) child node is auto generated by the `~/App_Code/PageComponents.cs` file. Once the "Save" or "Save and Publish" event for the configured parent document types is triggered, the child page components folder will auto generate.

### Page Components

There are some standard page components setup in the page component library including the following:

* [Grid Layout](v8/Page-Components/Doctype-Grid-Layout-Schema.md)
* Text with Image Section
  * Text with Image
* Banner Section
