# Component Settings Document Type Composition

The [Component Settings Document Type Composition](../../Starterkit-Package/v8/doctypes/Doctype-Comp-Settings-Schema.html) is installed with the Starterkit Package.

This document type is intended to be a base composition doctype to *most* page components in the component library however there will be some exceptions to this based on the site requirements. 

All of the page component partial view files that use this composition doctype will have the code in it to reference these basic general settings for the page component.

## Component Settings Document Type Schema

The Component Settings Document Type is setup with standard properties to adjust the background styling and spacing of the page component.
