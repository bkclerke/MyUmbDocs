# Introduction

This project contains documentation on my Umbraco process for buildouts. There are notes beginning with how to compile LESS and SASS and an initial site setup checklist when you have an Umbraco site running. Once the site is completely setup you can then move on to the starterkit package. The starterkit package installs the base requirements to build using the page components way of implementing content pages. This method gives content editors a lot of flexibility within Umbraco when they build their pages.
